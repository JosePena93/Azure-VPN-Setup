<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I create an Azure VM (Virtual Machine) where I download, install, and use a free VPN (Virtual Private Network) called ProtonVPN. <br />
<br />
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two commons ways VPNs are used are, for companies to allow for remote work, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.  
<br/>


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>ProtonVPN</b>
- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>

<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>


After creating a VM I navigated to this website https://whatismyipaddress.com to get my physical IP address and location. I wrote this down in my notepad so that I can observe the changes later when we connect to our VM:  <br/>

<br />
<br />

Once I connected to my VM I navigated to the same IP website, then observed and noted the different IP and location.  <br/>

<br />
I went over to ProtonVPN and signed up for a free account:  <br/>

<br />
After I made my account, I downloaded the windows version:  <br/>

After I signed in, i navigated to the homepage where I started the VPN connection by clicking quick connect:  <br/>

<br />

I then went to the IP address website and refreshed the page where it showed my location in Dallas Texas.:  <br/>

<h2> The Setup and Use of Proton is now Complete!</h2>

<b> We've successfully downloaded, installed, and used a free VPN called ProtonVPN! We observed all of the different changes that happened with our IP address and location.
